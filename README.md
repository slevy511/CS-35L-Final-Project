# CS-35L-Final-Project
Project Group 35 Fall 2022

## Stickies App
Our project is a web application that gives users the ability to create named boards of sticky notes. Users make an account and create sticky notes that they can organize into various personal boards. Users can sort and save sticky notes, and then search to find them.

## How to Run the Application
Make sure you have an up-to-date version of Node installed. `node --version` must be at least 16.17.0, which is the LTS version.
`cd` into a local directory you want to work in
Type `git clone https://github.com/slevy511/CS-35L-Final-Project.git` to clone the repository
Type `cd CS-35L-Final-Project` to change into the repo directory
Run `npm install` to install dependencies
Run `npm start` to start the application
The application should now be running on `localhost:3000` in your browser

## How to Contribute to the Project
`cd` into your local clone of the repository
